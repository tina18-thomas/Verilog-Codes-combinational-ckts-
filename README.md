# Verilog Practice: Combinational Circuits

This repository contains Verilog HDL implementations of basic **combinational logic circuits** that I have personally written and simulated using **Xilinx Vivado**.

Each design has been verified through simulation and testbenches wherever applicable.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- **Language:** Verilog HDL  
- **Software:** Xilinx Vivado (2020.2 or later)
- **Simulation:** Vivado built-in simulator

## ðŸ§ª How to Simulate

1. Open **Vivado**
2. Create a new **RTL Project** (donâ€™t add default sources)
3. Add the `.v` file(s) from this repo as source
4. (Optional) Add testbench if available
5. Run behavioral simulation using **Vivado Simulator**
